This document walks through the results of my code. Please see the code in the `assignment4b.R` file attached to the Canvas submission, or look at the last few pages of this document for my code. 



# Method 1: An Ideal Demand System

I present the results of the AIDS estimation by seemingly unrelated regression below:

# Method 2: Crawford Paper

I estimate the COLI approach from the 2022 Crawford paper. Note that this does not imply estimating any kind of regression, so I only present the average COL increase in % terms by province across all years. Please review my code if you need to know that I ran the actual model. I followed the given formula below:

$$ 1 + \pi = \dfrac{q'\cdot p'}{q \cdot p}$$
where variables with a prime are the ones estimated after the tax increase. The overall average across the years is 27.9699273%. 


```r
kable(average_col_province,
      format = 'latex',
      booktabs = TRUE,
      longtable = T)
```
